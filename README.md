## 📝 Project Description
My objective for this project was to showcase a variety of Unity skills and techniques. 
In addition to implementing the required game mechanics, I added:
 - Difficulty selection
 - Dynamic backgrounds in both scenes utilizing parallax, 3D elements, and dynamic lighting
 - Background music and sound effects
 - Behind-the-scenes logic to improve reusability and modularity
 - A live, playable build
 - And more!

When I first saw the example gif in the original task description, I immediately thought of a sci-fi
themed game where the player had to re-wire some component of a space ship to avoid disaster.
With that framing in mind, I began searching through the Unity asset store to find assets that would
bring my vision to life. I'm pretty happy with how it all came together, but obviously the overall
visual look is not as cohesive as it would be if we created our own assets from scratch.
But one of the strengths of Unity and the asset store ecosystem is the ability to quickly put together
prototypes and MVPs with temporary art that demonstrates the overall visual theme of the project.

Once the art was in place I implemented systems for menu/scene navigation, including the difficulty selector.
I wanted to expand on the baseline requirements by adding the different difficulties. Although the differences
between the easy, medium, and hard levels is minimal, including them demonstrates the flexibility of 
my implementation. 

Next I added logic to populate the levels according to json questions sets. Each level has its own question set,
but it is possible to use the same question set for all three.

Once the levels were set up I added the necessary elements to allow the player to use a drag-and-drop mechanic
to answer the questions. My approach does not exactly match the "wire matching" example because
I wanted to put my own spin on this project. 

Once the level was playable I added the end level sequence and other polish.

I enjoyed working on this project and look forward to feedback!
