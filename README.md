# 🎮 Unity Interview Task

## 📝 Task Description

In this task, you will be asked to develop a simple 2D game using Unity. Your task is to build a "Wire Matching" game 
like the example
below. 

![](./Assets/Included/wire-matching.gif)
![](./Assets/Included/Wires.gif)

The game you create should try to match the style and format of the example. For the game we will provide you with the 
list of matching questions. These will be given in a JSON format and can be found in the `Assests/Included` folder. You should use the JSON as a template for your own C# class or struct that includes the same fields and any relevant functionality you think the class should have. 

Even though your game will only have this one set of questions, the Wire Matching module you create should be able to take in any set of questions that follows the C# class or struct you define. Meaning the questions should not be hard coded in the Wire Matching module, but should be passed into the module as an instance of your class or struct. The goal is to allow question sets to be switched out quickly and easily. Like any good matching quiz, the display order of the question and answers should be randomly ordered. 


The game should have the following features:
- Ability to drag and drop "wires" to match questions to answers. 
- System or Script that marks answered questions as correct or incorrect.
- Ability to randomize the positioning of the questions and answers on the Wire Matching Module.
- Provide a grade report that presents the final grade of the activity.

## 📋 Requirements

- You may use any free art or design assets from the Unity Asset Store.
- You may NOT use any scripts from the Unity Asset Store. All code must be your own.
- You should use C# as the scripting language.
- You should use Git for version control and commit your work frequently.
- You should provide a brief write-up explaining the thought process behind your implementation.
- The game must include at least 2 scenes.
- The game must include a drag and drop mechanic for dragging and dropping the wires.
- The game must include a Unity animation.
- The game must be scalable to the most common aspect ratios.
- The game must be playable as a WebGL build
